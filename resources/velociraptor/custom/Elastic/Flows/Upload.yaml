description: |
  This server side event monitoring artifact waits for new artifacts
  to be collected from endpoints and automatically uploads those to an
  elastic server.

  We use the artifact name as the name of the index. This allows users
  to adjust the index size/lifetime according to the artifact it is
  holding.

type: SERVER_EVENT
