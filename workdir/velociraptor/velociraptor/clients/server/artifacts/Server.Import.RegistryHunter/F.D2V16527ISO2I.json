{"Name":"Windows.Registry.Hunter","Description":"This artifact parses and categorizes information for the registry.\n\nBuild time: 2025-07-10T03:42:37Z\n\nRead more about this artifact here https://github.com/Velocidex/registry_hunter\n\n## Collecting only few rules\n\nThis artifact contains thousands of rules and by default performs\ndeep registry analysis. If you do not need to apply all the rules,\nsimply navigate to:\n\n  https://registry-hunter.velocidex.com/docs/rules/\n\nSelect the rule you want and add the description to the\n`DescriptionFilter` parameter below.\n\n## RemappingStrategy\n\nIn order to present a unified view of all registry hives we remap various\nhives we remap various hives into the \"registry\" accessor. There are a\nnumber of strategies implemented for this:\n\n1. API - This strategy uses the API for the majority of hives including\n   user hives. Therefore users who are not currently logged in will not\n   have their NTUser.dat hives mounted.\n2. API And NTUser.dat - This strategy uses the API for most of the hives,\n   except for all the raw user hives will be mapped in HKEY_USERS.\n   Therefore all users will be visible.\n3. Raw Hives - This stragegy is most suitable for working off an image or\n    acquired hive files. All raw hives will be mapped (include SYSTEM, SOFTWARE etc).\n\nUsing the API will result in faster collection times, but may be some\ndifferences:\n\n* Some registry keys are blocked with API access, even for the system\n  user - so we get permission denied for these. Therefore, even with the API\n  stragegy above we remap the raw files into the \"raw_registry\" accessor.\n  The rule may work around this by using this accessor directly.\n* Some hive files are not accessible and can only be accessible using the\n  API (e.g. the BCD hives).\n","Author":"","_Source":"Server.Import.ArtifactExchange"}
